1. Introduction to Double Linked Lists
Definition and characteristics
Comparison with singly linked lists
Use cases and applications
2. Structure of a Double Linked List
Node structure in C
typedef struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
    struct Node* prev;
} Node;
Representation of the list (head and tail pointers)
3. Basic Operations
Insertion
At the beginning
At the end
At a specific position
void insertAtBeginning(Node** head, int data);
void insertAtEnd(Node** head, int data);
void insertAfter(Node* prevNode, int data);
Deletion
From the beginning
From the end
From a specific position
void deleteNode(Node** head, Node* delNode);
Traversal
Forward traversal
Backward traversal
void printList(Node* node);
void printListReverse(Node* node);
4. Advanced Operations
Reversing the list
void reverse(Node** head);
Searching for an element
Node* search(Node* head, int key);
Merging two double linked lists
5. Memory Management
Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation
Handling memory leaks
void freeList(Node* head);
6. Implementation Examples
Complete example programs demonstrating the basic operations
Advanced operation implementations
7. Performance Analysis
Time complexity of operations (insertion, deletion, traversal)
Space complexity
8. Advantages and Disadvantages
Pros of using double linked lists
Cons compared to other data structures (e.g., arrays, singly linked lists)
9. Applications
Real-world applications where double linked lists are used
Case studies or examples
10. Conclusion
Summary of key points
Final thoughts on when to use double linked lists
